    <!-- <p>The dog is a member of the genus Cannes, which forms part of the wolf-like canids, and is the most widely abundant terrestrial carnivore.<br>
      <img src="images\main1.jpg" alt=""><br>
    The dog and the extant grey wolf are sister taxa as modern wolves are not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated,<br>
    which implies that the direct ancestor of the dog is extinct. The dog was the first species to be domesticated,<br>
    and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviours, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.<br>
    <img src="images\main2.jpg" alt=""><br>
    Their long association with humans has led dogs to be uniquely attuned to human behaviour and they are able to thrive on a starch-rich diet <br>
    that would be inadequate for other canids.<br>
     Dogs vary widely in shape, size and colours.<br><img src="images\main 3.jpg" alt=""><br>
     They perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and military, companionship and ,<br>
     more recently, aiding disabled people and therapeutic roles.
